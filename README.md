# Rock-Paper-Scissors Game

This project allows the user to play Rock-Paper-Scissors against the computer. It was developed using HTML, JavaScript, TypeScript, SASS, and Vue.js. The game is designed to be fun and interactive, with accessibility and a smooth user experience in mind.

## Features

- **Choice Selection**: The user can choose between Rock, Paper, or Scissors using buttons or images.
- **Computer Random Choice**: JavaScript is used to generate a random choice for the computer.
- **Winner Determination**: The game compares the user's choice with the computer's choice to determine the winner.
- **Single Round Result**: The result (win, lose, or draw) is displayed after each round.
- **Best of 3**: The game plays in a best-of-3 format, and the first player to win 2 rounds is declared the winner of the session.
- **Animation Effect**: If the user wins a round, a fun animation (e.g., CSS shake effect or confetti) is triggered to celebrate.
- **Score Tracking**: The game keeps track of the score, awarding 1 point for each win in a session. The score updates after every round, and the user can play as many sessions as they wish.
- **Accessibility**: The game is designed with accessibility in mind, ensuring a smooth experience for all users.
