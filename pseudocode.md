# Pseudocode for Rock-Paper-Scissors Game

## General Behavior

This program is a simple implementation of the classic "Rock-Paper-Scissors" game. It allows the user to start a game, make a choice between "rock," "paper," or "scissors," and play against the computer. The game tracks scores and displays alerts to indicate the winner of each round and the overall winner of the game. Players can restart the game at any point.

## Core Functions

### **`determineWinner(player, computer)`**

- **Purpose**: Compares the player's choice and the computer's choice to determine the winner of the round.
- **Logic**:
  - If both choices are the same, it results in a draw.

### **`checkForWinner()`**

- **Purpose**: Checks if either the player or the computer has reached 3 points, indicating the end of the game.

  - If the computer reaches 3 points, a popup informs the player of their loss and encourages them to play again.
  - The game resets after the player closes the popup.
- **User Expectation**: The game should clearly indicate when someone has won, show a popup with a message, and reset for a new game.

### **`showPopup(message, imagePath)`**

- **Purpose**: Creates and displays a popup with a custom message and image.
- **Logic**:
